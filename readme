	All outputs (DVI+VGA)have been recognized as connected. If edid cannot be read, the resolution will be ¡°1024x768¡± by default.
	For SM768: HDMI will be a clone one of DVI output.
	Use ¡°insmod ./smifb.ko nopnp=1¡±

		Notes:If you build the driver with built-in method, the paramter
		you edited in the grub config file will be also the
		same format as above modular method,but additionaly add
		"video=smifb bpp=32" or "video=smifb nopnp=1"
		
	Build paremeter:

	1). If you use SM768 as secondary  card and let it work with onboard graphic driver to do extend display. Please compile the driver with "make prime=1". 
	In this situation, color depth will be set to 32bpp.
	2). If you want to use analog/HDMI audio on SM768, please compile the driver with "make audio=1"
